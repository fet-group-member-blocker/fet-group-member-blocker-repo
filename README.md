# Broken, do not use
This code will work for about 1 page an a half, or up to 2 pages of members, but then it will trip the Temporary Lock Out mechanism and ban you for 15 minutes (1st offense), 2hrs (2nd offense)

## If you're brave

1. Go to a page such as https://fetlife.com/groups/210991/members
2. F12 to open your console.
3. Open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fet-group-member-blocker/fet-group-member-blocker-repo/refs/heads/main/blocker.js in a new tab and copy all the content
4. Watch the code work. Eventually you'll see a red line that says 401. You can close your tab as you've now been locked out, but hey, you banned 30+ people first!
